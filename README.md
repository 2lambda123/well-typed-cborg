This package provides pure, efficient serialization of Haskell values directly
into `ByteString`s for storage or transmission purposes. By providing a set of
type class instances, you can also serialise any custom data type you have as
well.

The underlying binary format used is the 'Concise Binary Object
Representation', or CBOR, specified in `RFC 7049`. As a result, serialised
Haskell values have implicit structure outside of the Haskell program itself,
meaning they can be inspected or analyzed with custom tools.

This package is eventually intended to essentially replace the venerable
`binary` library. Aside from having a more concise format that has an
explicit structure, it's multiple times faster than competing libraries
as well in both the encode and decode paths. However, the current API only
provides CBOR serialization; it does not provide an independent notion of
parsing arbitrary binary data. This has yet to be designed or implemented.

**NOTE**: Currently this library has not been released to the public Hackage
server, although it has seen real production use (with good results).
Experimentation is encouraged, with a healthy dose of careful inspection and
analysis.

# Installation

It's just a `cabal install` away on [Hackage][], or through [Stackage][]:

```bash
$ cabal install binary-serialise-cbor
$ stack install binary-serialise-cbor
```

**NOTE**: The above currently **WILL NOT WORK**, as this package is not
publicly released.

# Join in

Be sure to read the [contributing guidelines][contribute]. File bugs
in the GitHub [issue tracker][].

Master [git repository][gh]:

* `git clone https://github.com/well-typed/binary-serialise-cbor.git`

Once you've done that, you can build it and run the tests:

```bash
$ cabal test
$ stack test
```

Note: the `stack.yaml` file is currently synchronized to **LTS-5.10**. Further
compilers and other LTS releases are currently not supported with Stack
at the moment, but the build *is* tested with older compilers and Cabal
libraries (through Travis CI).
